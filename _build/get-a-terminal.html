<h2 data-number="1.1" id="get-a-terminal"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Get a Terminal!</h2>
<p>You need to get a working terminal to follow the instructions in this book, because everyone who thinks he is cool uses a terminal.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="sec:linux"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Linux operating system</h3>
<p>Using Linux is the most straight-forward way to get a terminal. Just like Windows, IOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, Android, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, is powered by the Linux operating system. It is free to use, <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source</a>, widely used on clusters and good at automating your works. Linux kernel, Linux operating system and Linux distribution are different concepts. A <strong>Linux distribution</strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> made from a software collection that includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a> and, often, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system">package management system</a> The Linux kernel is started by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> in 1991.</p>
<p>The Linux distribution we will use for demoing and live-coding is the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a> distribution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> operating system.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="sec:shell"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Shell (or Terminal)</h3>
<p>Although you can use a <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI) to interact with your Linux distribution, you will find that the <strong>command line interface</strong> (CLI) is more efficient and powerful. The CLI is also known as the <strong>shell</strong> or <strong>terminal</strong>.</p>
<p>The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. <a href="https://zsh.org/">Zsh</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> are all shell interpreters used in the Linux operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Bash</strong>(Bourne-Again SHell) is the default shell on most Linux distributions. It is backward-compatible with the original Bourne shell and includes many additional features, such as command-line editing, job control, and shell scripting capabilities. Bash is widely used as it is both easy to use and has a large user community, resulting in a plethora of available resources (tutorials, scripts, etc.) online.</p>
<p><strong>Zsh</strong>(Z shell) is an extended version of the shell, with a more powerful command-line editing and completion system. It includes features like spelling correction and tab-completion, and it also supports plugins and themes. Zsh is commonly used by power users who require more productivity and efficiency from their command-line interface.</p>
<p>We will be using <code>Bash</code> during this course. In Ubuntu, one can use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>T</code> to open a <code>Bash</code> shell. In a <code>Bash</code> shell, we use <code>man command_name</code> to get help information related to a command, use <code>CTRL-C</code> to break a program and <code>CTRL-D</code> to exit a shell or an REPL.</p>
<p>The following is a short list of bash commands that will be used frequently in this book.</p>
<pre><code>man     # an interface to the system reference manuals

ls      # list directory contents
cd      # change directory
mkdir   # make directories
rm      # remove files or directories
pwd     # print name of current/working directory

echo    # display a line of text
cat     # concatenate files and print on the standard output

alias   # create an alias for a command

lscpu   # display information about the CPU architecture
lsmem   # list the ranges of available memory with their online status

top     # display Linux processes
ssh     # the OpenSSH remote login client
vim     # Vi IMproved, a programmer&#39;s text editor
git     # the stupid content tracker

tar     # an archiving utility</code></pre>
<p>The power and convinence provided by <code>Bash</code> far exceeds what this list can express.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1.3" id="sec:editor"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Vim Editor</h3>
<p>In order to write code, you need an editor. There are many editors available for you to choose from. We recommend the following editors for different purposes.</p>
<p><code>Vim</code> is a highly configurable and light-weight text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It can be found in any Linux distribution, with or without a graphical user interface. This feature makes it especially useful and essential to master when you are dealing with servers often. <code>Vim</code> is known for its modal editing, a design that allows the user to switch between different modes of operation, each tailored for specific tasks. The primary modes include <strong>Normal Mode</strong>, used for navigating and manipulating text; <strong>Insert Mode</strong>, where users can insert text as in conventional text editors; <strong>Visual Mode</strong>, enabling text selection for operations like cutting, copying, or formatting; <strong>Command Mode</strong>, where users input commands for tasks like saving files or searching; and <strong>Replace Mode</strong>, which is used to overwrite existing text. This modal approach in Vim optimizes efficiency by separating the tasks of editing and navigating, allowing for quicker and more precise text manipulation. Users can seamlessly switch between these modes, leveraging the unique capabilities of each to enhance their text editing workflow.</p>
<p>A few commands are listed below to get you started with <code>Vim</code>.</p>
<pre><code>i       # input
:w      # write
:q      # quit
:q!     # force quit without saving

u       # undo
CTRL-R  # redo</code></pre>
<p>All the commands must be executed in the <strong>command mode</strong>. If you are currently in the input mode, you can alway type <code>ESC</code> to go back to the command mode.</p>
<p>To learn more about Vim, please check this <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/">lecture</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, to edit the config file <code>~/.ssh/config</code> just type <code>vim ~/.ssh/config</code>.</p>
<h3 data-number="1.1.4" id="sec:ssh"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> SSH</h3>
<p>The programmer may not always have access to a powerful machine for both running and development of his code. He/she may “borrow” the power of a remote machine with the help of <code>ssh</code> command. The underlying work force of <code>ssh</code> is <strong>Secure Shell</strong>. <strong>Secure Shell</strong> is a network protocol that allows the user to take command of a remote server securely. After establishing the <strong>Secure Shell</strong> connection, the user can take command of a server via sending it shell commands.</p>
<p>With a host name (the IP of the target machine to login) and a user name, one can use the following command to login,</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> is the user name and <code>&lt;hostname&gt;</code> is the host name or IP of the target machine. You will get logged in after inputting the password.</p>
<p><strong>Tips to make your life easier</strong></p>
<p>It will be tedious to type the host name and user name everytime you want to login to the remote machine. You can setup the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to make your life easier. The following is an example of the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>Host amat5315
  HostName &lt;hostname&gt;
  User &lt;username&gt;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>amat5315</code> is the alias of the host. After setting up the <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, you can login to the remote machine by typing</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ssh amat5315</code></pre>
<p>If you want to avoid typing the password everytime you login, you can use the command</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ssh-keygen</code></pre>
<p>to generate a pair of public and private keys, which will be stored in the <code>~/.ssh</code> folder on the local machine. After setting up the keys, you can copy the public key to the remote machine by typing</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ssh-copy-id amat5315</code></pre>
<p>Try connecting to the remote machine again, you will find that you don’t need to type the password anymore.</p>
<p><strong>How does SSH key pair work?</strong> The SSH key pair is a pair of asymmetric keys, one is the public key and the other is the private key. In the above example, the public key is uploaded to the remote machine and the private key is stored on the local machine. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.</p>
<p>To connect to a server, the server needs to know that you are the one who with the right to access it. To do so, the server will need to check if you have the private key that corresponds to the public key stored on the server. If you have the private key, you will be granted access to the server.</p>
<p>The secret of the SSH key pair is that <strong>the public key can be used to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted by the private key</strong>, i.e. the public key is more like a lock and the private key is the key to unlock the lock. This is the foundation of the SSH protocol. So server can send you a message encrypted by your public key, and only you can decrypt it with your private key. This is how the server knows that you are the one who has the private key without actually sending the private key to the server.</p>
