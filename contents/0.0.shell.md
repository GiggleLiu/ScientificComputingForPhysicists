# Shell {#sec:shell}

You can take command of a server via sending it shell commands. To communicate
with a remote server, we will use `ssh`, a network protocol that allows you to
communicate with a remote server securely. To do so, we will need a tool for
establishing the `ssh` connection.

## SSH Client

For `Linux` users, just open a terminal and type `ssh username@server_address`
will do. A few terminal emulators I like are `gnome-terminal` and `alacritty`.

For `MacOS` users, it works the same as `Linux` users.

For `Windows` users, you may download PuTTY from <https://www.putty.org/> and
follow the instructions there to connect to a server. However, we will use an
IDE called Visual Studio Code. It came with a handy tool called `Remote SSH`.

In order to setup, you will need to setup the `~/.ssh/config` file. 

An example setup will be like 

```bash

```
