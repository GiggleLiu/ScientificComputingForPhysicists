## Why use Juliaï¼Ÿ


Julia was originally released in 2012 by Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, Jeff Bezanson, and Viral Shah. It is a free and open source programming language.

Choosing a programming language is always subjective. The following characteristics of Julia are decisive:

- Julia is developed as a high-performance programming language.

- Julia uses multiple dispatch, which allows the programmer to choose from different programming patterns adapted to the application.

- Julia is a dynamically typed language that can easily be used interactively.

- Julia has a nice high-level syntax that is easy to learn.

- Julia is an optionally typed programming language whose (user-defined) data types make the code clearer and more robust.

- Julia has an extended standard library and numerous third-party packages are available.


Julia is a unique programming language because it solves the so-called "two languages problem." No other programming language is needed to write high-performance code. This does not mean it happens automatically. It is the responsibility of the programmer to optimize the code that forms a bottleneck, but this can done in Julia itself.
