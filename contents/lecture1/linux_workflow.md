# The open source workflow
## Introduction and Motivation {#sec:intro}
Physicists have seen the use of computer in their work @Coelho_2021 (need more
citation). This book seeks to provide bare minimum knowledge for a physicist to
comfortably speedup their work with computers. The language we choose is
[Julia](https://julialang.org/). Julia is a dynamic language. Like other dynamic
language, Julia is easy to learn. Therefore, the potential barrier for adpoting
this tool for physicists is small. More importantly, it is easy to make your
Julia code run fast. Thanks to the complicated type system and C-like memory
structure, Julia code can use memory very efficiently (needs rewording).
Therefore, Julia code can achieve C-like performance which is very hard to beat.
Lastly, Julia has a vibrant [community](https://julialang.org/community/) and
open-source is a founding stone in the culture of us. This means you will never
be alone facing some problem in your work. And, you can easily be the one that's
contributing to the community.

It is as they say "An artisan must first sharpen his tools if he is to do his
work well". In order to start our journey in scientific computing, we need to
sharpen our tools. The most important tool in scientific computing and
programming in large is a good operating system. A good operating system should
be one where knowledge preservation and transmission is easy. By this standard,
Windows operating system is already out of the question since everything it does
involves a GUI. It is hard to make a followable step by step guide of doing
something. MacOS does not support NviDia GPU, it is therefore out of the
question. The only main-stream operating system left is Linux. We don't expect
all physicists to abandon their previous way of computation and learn how to use
Linux. A middle ground is taken. We will teach you how to take command of a
powerful server that runs Linux from any operating system in @sec:shell.
