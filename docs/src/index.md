# Who should read this book?

I am a book for those who aim to become professional scientific computing programmers. Before reading me, please make sure

* the problem you are trying to solve runs more than 10min,
* you want to become a tool builder rather than tools user, and you are happy with writing the tool with the Julia programming language.
